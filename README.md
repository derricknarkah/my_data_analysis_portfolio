## About
Hello, My name is Derrick Narkah, studying for a Master of Engineering (MEng) degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec. I have over seven (7) years working as an engineer in various roles. In all of this, I developed a keen interest in data science and analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence for about 4 years leveraging MOOC's, and short courses to increase my knowledge and practice.
Here is my Resume and a link of my certificates.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics, Data Science-related topics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
