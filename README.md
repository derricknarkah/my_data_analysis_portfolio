# Derrick Narkah - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
Hello, My name is Derrick Narkah, studying for a Master of Engineering (MEng) degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec. I have over seven (7) years working as an engineer in various roles. In all of this, I developed a keen interest in data science and analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence for about 4 years leveraging MOOC's, and short courses to increase my knowledge and practice.
Here is my Resume and a link of my certificates.

This repository serves to showcase my skills and as a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics, Data Science-related topics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

## Study Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the skills, technology stack, and results. I will also provide links to the code, files and screenshots where necessary.

### FBI Gun Data Analysis
**Code:** [Investigate a Dataset Project.ipynb](https://github.com/derricknarkah/FBI-Gun-Data-Project/blob/main/Investigate%20a%20Dataset%20Project.ipynb)
**Description:** The dataset is from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and the U.S Census Data. The NICS is used to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. The statistics in this dataset originally represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO "The Trace (2015), THE FBI'S NICS NUMBERS ARE WIDELY ACCEPTED AS THE BEST PROXY FOR TOTAL GUN SALES IN A GIVEN TIME PERIOD. All analysis that will be carried out with this dataset will be considered related to Gun Sales.
The project involved data wrangling, exploratory data analysis ,and some visualization.
**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Descriptive Statistics, Data Visualization.
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
**Results:** The analysis led to answering questions like
1.  What is the trend of Gun Sales across the U.S States?
2.  Can the Per Capita Income of a State reveal how guns are Purchased?
3.  Are the number of veterans in a State indicative of guns in the state?
4.  What is the Race distribution of the State with the highest number of Guns
